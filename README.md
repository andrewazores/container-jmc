## REQUIREMENTS
Build:
- JDK11+
- JMC
- Gradle

Run:
- Podman/Docker, OpenShift/Minishift, or other container platform

## BUILD
[container-jfr-core](https://github.com/rh-jmc-team/container-jfr-core) is a
required dependency, which is not currently published in an artefact repository
and so much be built and installed into the Maven local repository.
Instructions for doing so are available at that project's README.

Submodules must be initialized via `git submodule init && git submodule update`.

`container-jfr-web`, as a submodule located within the `web-client` directory,
must be prepared by running `pushd web-client; npm install; popd`.

Once the `container-jfr-core` local dependency is made available,
`./gradlew build` will build the project.

Tests can be run with `./gradlew check`, or for an interactive watch mode,
`./gradlew -it test`.

A Docker image can be built to your local Docker image registry using
`./gradlew jibDockerBuild`. Take note that the standard `./gradlew build`
will not only build the image but will attempt to publish it to Dockerhub.

If the environment variable `CONTAINER_JFR_DEBUG` is set to a non-empty
string at build time then a debug image will be built, containing a debug shell
environment within the image and enabling debug printing from the application.

## RUN
For a basic development non-containerized smoketest, use `./gradlew run`, or
`./gradlew run --args="client-args-here"`.

The client can operate in three different command execution modes. These are
batch (scripted), interactive TTY, and interactive socket. To use batch mode,
simply pass a single argument string to the client at runtime, ex.
`./gradlew run --args="'help; ip; hostname'"`. For interactive TTY mode, either
invoke the client with no args (`./gradlew run --args="''"`) or with the flag
`-it`: `./gradlew run --args="-it"`. And for interactive socket mode, pass the
flag `-d`: `./gradlew run --args="-d"`.

The `run.sh` script can be used to spin up a Docker container of the Container
JFR Client, running alone but set up so that it is able to introspect itself
with JFR. This can be achieved by doing `sh run.sh -it` and then typing
`connect container-jfr:9091` into the client shell that appears. When running in
this container, all three execution modes described above are still available
and accessible using the same mthods. Some client shell demo scripts are also
available in the `demos` directory. These can be used with batch mode, ex.
`sh run.sh "$(more demos/print_help)"`.

There are six environment variables that the client checks during its
runtime: `CONTAINER_JFR_WEB_HOST`, `CONTAINER_JFR_WEB_PORT`,
`CONTAINER_JFR_EXT_WEB_PORT`, `CONTAINER_JFR_LISTEN_HOST`,
`CONTAINER_JFR_LISTEN_PORT` and `CONTAINER_JFR_EXT_LISTEN_PORT`. The former
three are used by the embedded webserver for controlling the port and hostname
used and reported when making recordings available for export (download). The
latter three are used when running the client in daemon/socket mode and controls
the port that the client listens for connections on and which port is reported
should be used for connecting to the command channel (web)socket. These may be
set by setting the environment variable before invoking the `run.sh` shell
script, or if this script is not used, by using the `-e` environment variable
flag in the `docker` or `podman` command invocation. If the `EXT` variables are
unspecified then they default to the value of their non-EXT counterparts. If
`LISTEN_HOST` is unspecified then it defaults to the value of `WEB_HOST`.

The application can also be easily set up and configured to run in a more full-
fledged container application platform that supports the Docker/Podman
container image format, such as OpenShift. For an example of such a project
setup, see [jmc-robots-demo](https://github.com/rh-jmc-team/jmc-robots-demo/blob/master/minishift/setup.sh)

## MONITORING APPLICATIONS
In order for `container-jfr` to be able to monitor JVM application targets the
targets must have RJMX enabled. `container-jfr` has several strategies for
automatic discovery of potential targets. Each strategy will be tested in order
until a working strategy is found.

The primary target discovery mechanism uses the Kubernetes API to list services
and expose all discovered services as potential targets. This is runtime
dynamic, allowing `container-jfr` to discover new services which come online
after `container-jfr`, or to detect when known services disappear later. This
requires the `container-jfr` pod to have authorization to list services within
its own namespace.

The secondary target discovery mechanism is based on Kubernetes environment
variable service discovery. In this mode, environment variables available to
`container-jfr` (note: environment variables are set once at process creation -
this implies that this method of service discovery is *static* after startup)
are examined for the form `FOO_PORT_1234_TCP_ADDR=127.0.0.1`. Such an
environment variable will cause the discovery of a target at address
`127.0.0.1`, aliased as `foo`, listening on port `1234`.

Finally, if no supported platform is detected, then `container-jfr` will fall
back to a port-scanning discovery mechanism. All hosts in the /24 subnet that
`container-jfr` is within will be scanned for an open listening port. The
default expected listening port is 9091. Targets listening on other ports are
still connectable by `container-jfr` but will not be automatically discoverable
via port-scanning.

To enable RJMX on port 9091, the following JVM flags should be passed at target
startup:

```
    '-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=9091',
    '-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false',
    '-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false'
```

The port number 9091 is arbitrary and may be configured to suit individual
deployments, so long as the two `port` properties above match the desired port
number and the deployment network configuration allows connections on the
configured port. As noted above, the final caveat is that in non-Kube
deployments, port 9091 is expected for automatic port-scanning target discovery.
